My name is Anthony Hart. I'm a current Data Science student with an interest in the theory of programming and the foundations of mathematics.

## History

I started programming in C++ when I was 12, since then I've gained experience in a multitude of languages from Python, to Haskell, to Prolog, and more. I tend to program in Mathematica when prototyping and Haskell then implementing an actual application. I have an interest in emulation (a while back I implemented a [simple emulator](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/138003?p_p_auth=UdH7DgrD) in Mathmatica) and implementing mathematics on computers. For a while, I had an obsession with computer algebra systems, and I implemented a basic one as one of my first program. It was awful and the code is lost to time, now, but at

I've also had an interest in the foundations of mathematics for over a decade. My interest began when I was 14. Through my self-study, I eventually found and made small contributions to the [Metamath project](http://us.metamath.org/). After that, I got experience with a wider variety of perspectives on the foundations of mathematics, about HoL from [Issabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/), and about dependent type theory from [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php). Some of my repositories relate to formally verified mathematics through dependent type theory. Nowadays, I'm interested in extensional approaches to type theory along the lines of [Cedille](https://cedille.github.io/) and the various PRLs.

From that experience, I make a hobby out of creating programming languages with sophisticated type-systems, some of which are capable of acting as foundations for mathematics. The handful that I've finished are posted to GitHub, but I'm constantly working one some new idea. The green icon on top of my blog comes from a graphical programming language that unfortunately never came to fruition. It denotes the type

    Î  x : nat . id(nat, plus(x, zero) x)

## Hopes for the Future

I'm currently going through [Lambda School's](https://lambdaschool.com) data science program. I hope to eventually get a stable job related to machine learning. And perhaps, one day, I can make the perfect fusion of mathematics and a programming language.
